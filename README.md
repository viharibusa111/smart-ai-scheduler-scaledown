# 🚀 Smart AI Intelligent Scheduler

An AI-powered scheduling assistant that automatically finds optimal meeting times using intelligent agents, preference learning, and optimization logic.

This project demonstrates how GenAI-style systems can manage calendars, reduce scheduling conflicts, and optimize productivity.

## 🧠 Features

- Availability Agent (detects free slots with buffer time)
- Preference Learner (learns user behavior patterns)
- Optimization Agent (scores and selects best time)
- Multi-Party Negotiation Protocol
- Cancellation Prediction System
- Smart AI Command Parsing
- ScaleDown Memory Compression (simulated)
- Meeting Analytics Dashboard

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

User enters a natural language command:
schedule meeting tomorrow at 3pm


The system:

1. Parses intent using AI-style command parser
2. Learns scheduling preferences
3. Predicts risky meeting times
4. Finds available slots
5. Optimizes meeting placement
6. Outputs intelligent reasoning

## ▶️ Run Project


Example command:
schedule high priority meeting avoid mornings

## 🧱 Architecture

Agents used:

- Availability Agent
- Optimization Agent
- Preference Learner
- Negotiation Protocol
- Analytics Engine

---

## 📉 ScaleDown Integration

Schedule history is compressed to simulate 80% memory reduction, enabling scalable coordination for large teams.

## 🎓 Project Purpose

Built as a GenAI scheduling system demonstrating:

- Agent-based architecture
- AI reasoning logic
- Smart automation workflows
